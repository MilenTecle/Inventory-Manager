## My Inventory
1. Once logged in, the user can create an inventory list immediately. First by choosing a unique name for the inventory list. If a list name already exists, the user will get an error message. A "General" category is provided for the user, so that the user can get started quickly and add/modify categories further on. The user will then get a success message of the created inventory list, and will be redirected to the Itemsform, to add the items to the list.

2. The user can add several items at once and will recieve a success message upon added items, and error messages if no items are added. The user can't save an empty list. When the user clicks on save list, the user will be redirected to the dashboard with a success message of successful save.

3. The list is now saved and visible on the dashboard with number 1 appended to the list name. The next list will have the number 2 and so on. The lists will alsbo be ordered alfabetically. The QR code-image is rendered when the list is saved, so the user can now scan the QR-code.

4. The user can download the QR-code image, that will open i a new tab. The user can also share the link to the QR-code via email with a prepopulated email.

5. The user can also clone a list by clicking on "clone list". There, the user can edit, delete and add items. When saved, the user will get a success message and be redirected to the dashboard where the cloned list now will be visible.

6. If the user clicks on "view details" the user will get to a view where the user can click on "edit list" or "delete list". If the user clicks on delete list, the user will be prompted to confirm deletion, and a success message will render. The user will be redirected to the Itemsform if user clicks on "edit list".

## Categories
- The user can create categories, also with unique names to prevent duplicates. The user will get an error message if a category already exists.
- When saved, the category will be visible on the category page.
- The user can edit a category by using inline editing so that the user can stay on the page, and a save button will appear. When saved, user will get a success message.
- The user can delete a category. If the user wants to delete a category the user needs to confirm deletion. The user will get a success message after deletion.

### Features left to implement
  - When a user shares an inventory list, the user can choose if it's only read permisson or edit and/or delete permission.
  - When a user wants to clone the orignial list again, the user will get an error message saying "The invenontory has already been cloned". I've added that as a solution to not violate the unique name constraint. In the future, I would like to implement so that
  an incrementing number, starting from 1 is appended after the word "cloned" to get around this problem.
  - Create a view on the landing page so that non registered users can see a QR code containing an example list. The share and download links are disabled so that the user can see what features are available for a registered user.
  - Let the user choose to have public or private lists so that other users can copy another users list.
  - Implement a search bar, so the user can search for inventories if there are many inventory lists.
  - Implement pagination in case of many inventory lists, in particular on mobile view.


## Testing
Testing and the results can be found [here](/TESTING.md).

## Security Features

### Form Validation
If empty or incorrect data is added to a form, the form won't submit. An error will arise, informing the user what field caused the error.

### User Authentication
Limits access for non-registred users and permission control so that only the owner of a list can edit and delete a list when shared with others.

### Database Security
- All passwords, API keys, ID:s and the database url are stored in the env.py file to ensure that sensitive information is not shared, along with env.py being listed in the gitignore file.
- CSRF tokens are used on all forms throughout the application.
